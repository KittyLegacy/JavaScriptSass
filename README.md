JavaScript Assessment

# What do you like about this projct?

Its more challenging then expected and i had fun doing it!


# What did you struggle with in this project?

I think the whole assessment in general was quite a struggle, but its managable. 


# What would make your experience with this assessment better?

Nothing that i can think of,because if instructor were to give too many hint then it wont be challenging at all and that wont be progressive.
